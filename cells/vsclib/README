# 9 track standard cell library with height of
# 72 lambda and a pitch of 8 lambda. Lambda
# values for different technologies are:

# techno  lambda  snap grid
# 0.35um  0.175   0.025
# 0.25um  0.125   0.025
# 0.18um  0.08    0.01
# 0.13um  0.055   0.005
# 0.09um  0.04    0.005

# vsclib with ALU1 used for metal-1 requiring an
# 8 lambda pitch and POLY2 for metal-1 requiring
# a 7 lambda pitch. The 8 lambda pitch applies
# only for ALU1-ALU1 separations.

# TALU1 is used as an obstacle layer for ALU1,
# but is currently ignored by the Alliance tools.

# TALU8 is used as a drawn and named abutment
# box.
